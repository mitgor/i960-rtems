# Repository guidance for Claude Code

**Local handoff:** See [artifacts/ROM-INVENTORY.md](artifacts/ROM-INVENTORY.md) and [artifacts/ROM-DUMP-WORKLOG.md](artifacts/ROM-DUMP-WORKLOG.md). Original Fujitsu packages (29 and 39), decoded ROMs, all snapshot sessions, disassemblies and collector are local; SSH is unnecessary for offline analysis.

Read **[SNAPSHOT-RECOVERY.md](SNAPSHOT-RECOVERY.md)** first. In-system recovery
succeeded: two matching 512 KiB image captures contain the exact 4.07-0-29
firmware, exact FWTCBBLK boot block, and independently verified PCI BIOS.
Archived binaries are in artifacts/private-dumps/ and are intended for Git; hashes
and transaction evidence are in artifacts/analysis/snapshot-20261010/.

The live layout uses the 512 KiB profile, with firmware at offset 0x30000.
Earlier 256 KiB/offset-0x8000 assumptions and claims that no firmware dump exists
are superseded. host/dump permits only Enquiry2 and read opcode 0x20; never use
0x21 to retrieve data. The controller remains driverless. Do not automatically
unbind myrb, upload, program, or reset it. Paired staging reads do not replace
the independent backup gate before flashing.

Read **DRAM-ANALYSIS.md** for the remote environment exploration, successful
i960 target build, g14 startup fix, and the two recovered board-register profiles.
Their DRAM bit-field meanings remain unverified.

Read **PROJECT-REVIEW.md** for the 2026-10-10 whole-project review focused on
in-system firmware dumping. It qualifies earlier impossibility claims and flags
the probe's opcode truncation/completion/DMA issues. Its no-dump status is historical; prioritize offline analysis of the recovered
firmware and boot block.

**Hardware correction:** internal RAM at 0x000..0x3ff is DATA ONLY. The loader's
hello-at-0x200 execution plan is invalid (Intel manual §4.1), despite passing native
tests. Do not treat the previous loader milestone as hardware-ready.

This repository contains native i960 code, a host emulator, firmware analysis,
and a DAC960PG flash loader. Start with README.md and FINDINGS.md for context.

For **loader/** work, read loader/CLAUDE.md, loader/README.md,
loader/PROTOCOL.md, and loader/REVIEW.md. These describe the 2026-10-10 protocol
fixes, address policy, native tests, and outstanding hardware/target-build gates.
The loader demo now marks execution in OMR1 and preserves OMR0's GO ACK.

Run `make -C loader test` to validate loader software without hardware. Target
builds require the i960 cross-toolchain. Do not equate emulator/native tests with
physical card validation. Firmware replacement must follow REFLASH.md and its
external-programmer backup gate.
