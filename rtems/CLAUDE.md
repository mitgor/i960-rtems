# RTEMS working guidance

**Resident ownership batch (2026-10-11):** the separate persistent `ownership`
profile passed a 48-callback smoke run and three 371-callback sessions: real
priority-inheritance mutex, owner-only release, blocked waiter, cancellation
rollback, software-reference deferral, stale/duplicate completion rejection,
clean owner restart with new epochs, and owner/waiter quarantine while an
unrelated worker continues. These are bounded persistent callbacks, not the
asynchronous IRQ profile. A premature final close retained dirty state, DMA,
BAR and module with pending=0 and refused ordinary unload. After reboot, a
further 48-callback run passed full restoration; production IPv6 HTTP returned
200. Total: 1,209 normally completed callbacks, 62 rollback/handoffs and five
normal closes, plus the three-callback retained-close test. No flash writes.
[Contract, evidence and next integration gate](ownership/README.md). Earlier next-step
statements below are historical. Do not force-unlock a quarantined resource,
delete its tasks, reuse its stacks, or treat a software lease as a DMA drain.


**Automatic containment batch (2026-10-11):** six final critical-section
sessions passed (three per depth), following six initial passes. STOP at ticks
18/30 deferred controller execution until outer release at tick 40; external
suspension completed at tick 44. The final module removes a stack-frame warning.
Three separate failure tests retained resources: omitted STOP/final close,
omitted RELEASE/unbind, and invalid local report after real callback completion.
The last case returned ENODATA and retained dirty state with pending=0, proving
retention does not depend solely on an outstanding command. All refused unload;
evidence was saved before each reboot. All three reboots and final fresh
preflight passed; production IPv6 HTTP is restored. [Results and next gate](switch/CONTAINMENT-BATCH.md).
General resident task cancellation, permanent interrupt masks and DMA ownership
remain unproven; keep production on bounded autonet.

**STOP-ignoring worker containment (2026-10-11):** three live `contain`
sessions passed. Both workers continued four ticks after STOP, then the
controller externally suspended them, restored the timer and returned. Each
worker retained one live ISR continuation; task/ISR stacks were kept intact
until callback return, with 10,000 stable checks. The distinct QUIESCED token
and exact-image-pinned host gate prevent confusing suspension with draining.
Full RAM/MU restoration and unload passed each time; HTTP restored, no reboot
or flash. [Contract, results and limits](switch/CONTAINMENT.md).
This disposes of a bounded one-shot RTEMS instance; permanent interrupt masking,
scheduler corruption and resource-safe cancellation in a resident OS remain
unproven. Next: bounded critical-section containment and failure-path coverage.

**Failed-control teardown checkpoint (2026-10-11):** both live injection cases
passed: omitted STOP during final-user-fd close, and omitted RELEASE during
unbind. Both syscalls returned ETIMEDOUT; pending/dirty state, DMA/BAR and module
references remained retained. No post-failure firmware commands or cleanup/free
occurred; ordinary unload was refused. Completion became visible but was not
consumed after the control error. These are synthetic omissions on a responsive
card, not physical PCI faults. Evidence was saved before each recovery reboot.
Both reboots completed; fresh preflight passed and IPv6 HTTP returned 200.
[Contract, findings and reproduction](switch/FAILED-TEARDOWN.md).
Next: non-cooperative task containment; production stays on bounded autonet.

**Final-close / driver-unbind checkpoint (2026-10-11):** six final hardware
runs passed: three closes of the sole user descriptor and three sysfs unbinds
while callback/control syscalls were active. Release/removal waited for the
operations; restoration preceded BAR unmapping, and late calls were refused.
All target contexts and full RAM/MU cleanup passed; HTTP restored, no reboot/flash.
An initial truncated removal log was preserved and its publication fixed before
rerunning. [Contract and findings](switch/LIFECYCLE.md),
[evidence](../artifacts/irq-lifecycle-20261011/README.md).
Logical unbind is tested; the later failed-control checkpoint above covers
synthetic omissions during teardown. Physical hot-unplug remains unproven. Task shutdown still cooperates with a stop flag.


**Concurrent host control (2026-10-11):** three card runs passed with STOP
issued by an ioctl on a second host thread while the firmware callback was
pending. A separate control mutex/window is joined before completion/cleanup;
wrong epochs, duplicate STOP and late requests were refused. Both ISR contexts
drained; full RAM/MU restoration and unload passed. IPv6 HTTP restored.
[API and lifetime contract](switch/CONCURRENT.md),
[evidence](../artifacts/irq-concurrent-control-20261011/README.md).
Workers remain stop-aware. Live alias-close coverage is not final-close or
physical-removal fault injection; next are broader lifecycle failure tests and
non-cooperative task containment.


**Live web system information (2026-10-11):** the IPv6 Vader page now shows
card runtime uptime, RTEMS/lwIP and CPU details, memory capacities, HTTP counts
and RX/TX/drop counters. CPU utilization and temperature are explicitly
unavailable; measured timer-bus frequency is not labelled as CPU frequency.
24 live HTTP checks and full cleanup/restart passed. Production module is now
`autonet-module-system-info`, paired with the updated `autonet` image.
[Details](net/SYSTEM-INFO.md), [artifacts](../artifacts/rtems-system-info-20261011/README.md).


**Nested STOP and timeout checkpoint (2026-10-11):** all twelve `stopcases`
card runs passed. STOP at critical depths 2/1 was recorded at ticks 18/30 but
controller dispatch/drain waited until outer release at tick 40. Missing STOP
reached the 128-tick event deadline; missing RELEASE exhausted its finite loop
and returned with only the expected `0x4000` flag. All contexts, guards, paired
RAM/MU restoration and unload checks passed; no reboot/flash. IPv6 HTTP restored.
[Implementation](switch/STOP-CASES.md),
[evidence](../artifacts/irq-stop-cases-20261011/README.md).
Next: concurrent user-control/lifetime design and non-cooperative task containment.
These workers remain stop-aware; deliberate message omission is not a full host
crash or proof of recovery from permanently masked interrupts.


**Pending-callback MU STOP milestone (2026-10-11):** three `mustop` card runs
accepted a one-shot host STOP at ticks 34/41/52 while both owned ISR contexts
were live and firmware sequence 1 was still pending. Workers observed the stop
flag, both contexts drained, and the card acknowledged before host RELEASE
allowed the callback to return. Zero faults; full RAM/MU restoration and module
unload passed. IPv6 Vader HTTP restored. [Evidence](../artifacts/irq-mu-stop-20261011/README.md).
This is a serialized host-driver experiment, not a concurrent control ioctl,
CTL1 framing, or forced termination of code that ignores the stop flag. Next:
exercise STOP during nested dispatch deferral and the missing-host deadline;
then generalize the control API and non-cooperative task containment.


**Nested dispatch-deferral milestone (2026-10-11):** three `defer` card runs
kept task A executing through four timer ticks at dispatch depth 2 and four at
depth 1. All eight IRQs observed a pending switch to a different heir; task B
started only after the outer enable. A resumed at tick 9, depth 0. Each run
finished at tick 32 with zero faults, 20/20 and 12/12 ISR entries/returns,
verified RAM restoration and module unload. IPv6 Vader HTTP returned 200 after
restart. [Evidence](../artifacts/irq-deferral-20261011/README.md).
Next: integrate independent MU STOP with the two CPU-bound task contexts and
prove safe draining during an active callback. Resident operation and general
interrupt nesting remain unproven; production stays on `autonet`.


**Two-task interrupt-switch milestone (2026-10-11):** three bounded card runs
passed timer-driven switching between CPU-bound RTEMS tasks. Each run recorded
32 IRQ-path handoffs, 31 observations of both ISR continuations live, and 16
entries/returns per task. Separate task/ISR stacks, register sentinels, frame
ownership, draining and full restoration passed; web service restored without
reboot/flash. [Implementation](switch/README.md),
[evidence](../artifacts/irq-switch-20261011/README.md). This is bounded preemption,
not a resident monitor; next are deferred-dispatch stress and MU STOP integration
while the CPU-bound task contexts are active.

**Owned ISR stack milestone (2026-10-11):** an owned, guarded C interrupt stack
and explicit GPR/TC preservation passed 126 isolated stress interrupts and 546
bounded RTEMS/control interrupts. Deep call chains, sentinels, PC/TC roundtrips,
frame/guard checks and independent STOP/HALT passed; full cleanup and web restart
passed without reboot/flash. The hardware entry frame stays in place: movable
per-task interrupt contexts and unrestricted preemption remain future work.
[Implementation](interrupt/README.md),
[evidence](../artifacts/owned-interrupt-stack-20261011/README.md).

**Current development roadmap:** [loader memory extension, RTEMS and remaining gaps](../DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md). Next: M1, generalize the proven larger RAM profile; preserve scalar/BIO1 compatibility.


Read [README.md](README.md) and the dated artifact report before changing this
port. It already runs real RTEMS Classic tasks and lwIP on the i960RP, with
card-originated DNS/TCP/HTTP through the Linux host.

Preserve the cooperative contract: firmware owns its interrupt vectors/timers,
RTEMS stays at priority 31 during each bounded call, and the outer entry restores
firmware priority. The host supplies elapsed time. A standalone/preemptive BSP
or independent mailbox transport has not been validated.

Only the known staging allocation is borrowed. Keep RIO1 workspace limits,
immutable guards, paired readbacks, sequence/no-retry rules, failure pinning,
exclusive ownership and full close restoration. Do not alter Tetris's BIO1
layout to fit RTEMS. Do not force-unload a pending/uncertain module.

The old RTEMS BSP's interrupt/clock code contains board assumptions and defects;
never enable it just because it compiles. Current Newlib use is headers plus a
small freestanding runtime, and lwIP uses the raw API from one RTEMS task.

`make -C rtems test` is offline. `deploy.py` builds in a new remote directory and
does not touch hardware. `transport/relay.py` is an explicit live test which may
also change routing when `--internet` is provided; it saves a cleanup journal.
Use fresh output directories and retain exact target/module/source hashes.
Artifact source snapshots are historical evidence and must not be modernized.

## IPv6 milestone (2026-10-11)

The current net target is dual-stack. See [usage](README.md#ipv6-usage-and-scope)
and [evidence](../artifacts/rtems-ipv6-20261011/README.md). Installed launcher:
`/home/mit/i960-rtems-ipv6-20261011/serve.sh --ipv6`; `--internet6` enables NAT66
and IPv4 DNS routing. Raw IP input is operation 1; operation 5 selects AAAA/IPv6
HTTP, while operation 2 remains IPv4. Static ULA, MTU 1500, no fragmentation,
SLAAC or autonomous polling. Keep shared `lwip_patches.py` DNS packing and
mandatory IPv6 UDP checksum adaptation in native and target builds. Preserve
IPv6 forwarding/accept_ra journal rollback and verify both IP families.

## Web and hardware-interrupt checkpoint

See [current report](../artifacts/rtems-web-autonomous-20261011/README.md).
The `net` profile serves bounded HTTP on port 80. `--publish-http6 <host-global>`
with `--internet6` explicitly publishes it through DNAT (default port 8080).
Only four clients and 512-byte headers are supported.

The separate `irq` profile proved eight hardware interrupts/eight RTEMS task
wakeups and restored timer/vector/mask state. `auto` and `autonet` now pass
host-silent progression tests (20 and five seconds respectively). Use only the
exact image-pinned `dac960auto` transport from `autonomous/build_transport.py`
(`--network` for autonet: STOP operation 6; auto uses STOP 2). Kernel release
verifies STOP before RAM restoration, including SIGKILL and a completed
application error. Live cleanup passed for both signals and invalid operation.
Never load an autonomous image with the cooperative transport. Retain stock
interrupt sources, preserve timer 0, and keep IRQ work bounded. This does not
establish nested IRQ support, unrestricted preemption or independent transport.

The host relay also supports persistent HTTP visitor accounting via `--visitor-log`.
The deployed autonomous launcher enables it. See [visitor logging](transport/VISITORS.md)
for paths, counting semantics and tests. Keep real visitor databases/statistics
on the host, out of Git; no firmware rebuild is needed for this feature.

## Preemption and DMA roadmap (2026-10-11)

See the [staged preemption and DMA plan](../RTEMS-PREEMPTION-DMA-PLAN.md). Order: independent control
and ownership prerequisites → arbitrary application-task preemption → host-RAM
DMA networking → gated direct peer experiments. Read-only direct-DMA research
has started; current NIC and Mylex occupy separate PCI branches. This is a plan
and initial inventory, not implemented preemption or verified peer DMA. Keep
the active web service on the existing bounded runtime.

## P0/P1 audit and prototype checkpoint (2026-10-11)

The [interrupt audit](control/INTERRUPT-AUDIT.md) is written. The
[control protocol prototype](control/README.md) passes native tests
and a two-process shared-memory demo, and cross-compiles for i960. Read-only
PCI configuration confirms PIATVR=C0000000 and the existing 8 KiB window.
No live independent control writes are enabled: the MU overlay/index interrupt
side effects and stock mailbox/stack ownership still require a proven reservation.
This completes the offline prototype, not P1 physical validation or preemption.

## Control ownership follow-up (2026-10-11)

The [matching-firmware ownership trace](control/OWNERSHIP.md) identifies active handler/fault
data and mailbox/interrupt-stack uses in the BAR window. No RAM slot is reserved.
Three read-only MU samples found IMR1/OMR1 zero with message interrupts masked.
These are selected for a separate, driver-serialized bounded echo experiment;
no live sideband writes have occurred. Use the pinned 4.07-0-29 evidence, not the
older 4.07-0-39 `remote-analysis` reference.
